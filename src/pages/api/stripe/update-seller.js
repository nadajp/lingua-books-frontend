If you store data both locally (in your own database) and in Stripe, and a user wants to change their name or address, you'd typically follow a flow that updates both data sources to ensure consistency. Here's a step-by-step outline:

User Makes a Request: The user submits a change request through your application's user interface.

Local Update: First, update the data in your local database. This ensures that the most immediate representation of the user's data (what they see on the site) is updated as soon as possible.

Stripe Update: Next, make an API call to Stripe to update the user's data there.

javascript
Copy code
const stripe = require('stripe')('your_stripe_secret_key');

// Assuming you've stored the Stripe customer ID in your local database
const stripeCustomerId = user.stripeCustomerId;

const updatedCustomer = await stripe.customers.update(stripeCustomerId, {
  name: 'New Name',
  address: {
    line1: 'New Address Line 1',
    city: 'New City',
    postal_code: 'New Postal Code',
    // ... other address fields
  }
});
Error Handling: It's possible that one of these operations (either the local update or the Stripe update) could fail. You'll need to handle these situations gracefully:

Local Update Fails: If the local update fails, don't proceed to the Stripe update. Inform the user about the error and maybe log the issue for debugging.

Stripe Update Fails: If the Stripe update fails, you have a discrepancy between your local data and Stripe's data. You can:

a. Revert Local Data: Undo the change in your local database and inform the user that the update failed.

b. Retry Stripe Update: Sometimes, network glitches or transient errors can cause an operation to fail. You could retry the Stripe update a set number of times before determining it's a permanent failure.

c. Log and Notify: If there's a failure updating Stripe, log the issue and potentially notify an admin or developer. This way, discrepancies can be resolved manually if necessary.

Success Response: Once both updates are successful, return a success response to the user, confirming that their data has been updated.

Sync Jobs (Optional): As a failsafe, you might consider having periodic sync jobs that compare local data against Stripe data to ensure consistency. If discrepancies are found, they can be flagged for manual resolution.*/
